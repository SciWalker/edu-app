## Task List: AI Agent Development (Starting with a Chatbot)

### 1. Planning & Requirements
- Define the chatbot’s primary use case (e.g., FAQ, tutoring, scheduling, etc.)
- Identify target users and their needs
- List core features (text chat, context awareness, integrations, etc.)
- Decide on the platform (web, mobile, messaging app, etc.)

### 2. Architecture & Technology Stack
- Choose programming language(s) (e.g., Python, JavaScript)
- Select AI/NLP frameworks (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Rasa, HuggingFace, LangChain)
- Plan backend infrastructure (cloud, local server, serverless, etc.)
- Decide on database/storage solutions for logs, user data, etc.

### 3. Data Collection & Preparation
- Gather sample conversations, FAQs, or relevant datasets
- Clean and preprocess data (anonymize, format, etc.)
- Define intents and entities (if using intent-based approach)

### 4. Model Selection & Training
- Choose between pre-built models (e.g., GPT-3/4, Llama) or custom training
- Fine-tune model on your dataset (if needed)
- Evaluate model performance (accuracy, relevance, safety)

### 5. Backend & API Development
- Set up backend server (e.g., FastAPI, Flask, Node.js)
- Implement endpoints for chat interaction
- Integrate with chosen AI/NLP model
- Add logging and analytics

### 6. Frontend Development
- Design a simple chat UI (web/mobile)
- Connect frontend to backend via API/WebSocket
- Implement user authentication (optional)

### 7. Testing
- Unit tests for backend logic
- Integration tests for end-to-end chat flow
- User acceptance testing with sample users

### 8. Deployment
- Set up hosting (cloud provider, on-premise, etc.)
- Configure CI/CD for automated deployment
- Monitor uptime and errors

### 9. Iteration & Expansion
- Collect user feedback
- Improve model responses and UX
- Plan for multi-modal input (voice, images) or agentic actions

- Develop minimum viable platform with one Quest Pack
- Conduct pilot testing with target age group
